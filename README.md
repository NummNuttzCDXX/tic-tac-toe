An Odin Assignment <br>
<br> <b>Features: </b> <br>
<ul>
    <li>An unbeatable ai oponent or play with a friend <ul>
        <li> Soon to be beatable ai oponent </li> </ul> </li>
    <li>A scoreboard </li>
	<li> Cool color scheme </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> In working on this project I learned how to organize my code with factory functions and modules, and how the minimax algorithm works for making ai oponents in simple 2 player games. </p>
<p> I learned about encapsulating my code with "private" functions in javascript and how all my modules and objects can work together. I also learned how functions looping together can be beneficial and effective when generic loops wont work. </p>
